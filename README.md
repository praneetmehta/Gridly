# Gridly
Create beautiful grid of all your album arts with ease..Gridly !!

![Grid Example](https://github.com/praneetmehta/Gridly/blob/master/test3-16:9.jpg)

You can easily run a single command and create beautiful grid of your album arts. 
First of all you need to install a simple dependency called mutagen

  `pip install mutagen`
  
and there you go.

Just run the the file using python as

  `python gridly.py 100`
  
Here 100 is the size of each individual album art in the grid in pixels. You can give any number you want but remember size
and processing time increases with size.

Future Plans - 
- Random size album arts in the grid
- more customization options
